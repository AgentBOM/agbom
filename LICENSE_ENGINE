PolyForm Internal Use License 1.0.0

Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

Copyright and Patent License

The licensor grants you a copyright and patent license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright or patent claims in it, but only for internal business use by you and your company.

Internal Business Use

Internal business use means use of the software for the internal operations of your business or company, other than:

1. using the software to provide any service to anyone outside your company

2. distributing the software outside your company

3. sublicensing the software

4. making any other use of the software that is commercial in any way

Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, all your licenses for the software granted under these terms end immediately. If your company makes such a claim, all your licenses end immediately for work on behalf of your company.

Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

No Liability

As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.

Definitions

The licensor is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the software is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.

A company is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization. Control means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be direct or indirect.

Your company is any company that you work for or on behalf of.

Your licenses are all the licenses granted to you for the software under these terms.

Use means anything you do with the software requiring one of your licenses.
